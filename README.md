# Data-structure-and-algorithm-using-modern-cpp
> Data structure and algorithm implementation using modern c++. Here I gonna share some of my codes about some interesting and useful ideas related to data structure and algorithms.

> In this repo, I'll provide some interesting problems and my codes related to them.

> - **Algorithms related to data structure.(in dir: `data_structure_and_related_algorithm`)**
> - **Algorithm related to some interesting problems.(in dir: `algorithm`)**
>
> > Dir `CXX_TEST` is just a place for me to test my codes.

> I'll also write some articles to point out some critical points in the algorithms and data structures. But I feel sorry that most of the works will be written in Chinese(As Chinese is my mother language. Acctually my English is pretty good, the reason why I use Chinese is that my time is limited and I have to write articles fast... And I'm not sure my description in English will be rigorous). **But I make sure that all the annotations will be written in English.**
